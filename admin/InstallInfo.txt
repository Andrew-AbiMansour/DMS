DMS is a multiscale molecular dynamics simulator for macromolecular and nanofluidic systems.

The precompiled binary distributions come with threads support for efficient parallelization on multi-core workstations, but if you want to use large-scale MPI parallelization you will need to build from source on the target system due to MPI library compatibility issues.
